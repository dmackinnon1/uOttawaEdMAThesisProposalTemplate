\abstract{A brief summary of the proposal is provided here. Use this space to sell your proposal in a few sentences - it isn't easy to get this right. In the 6290 course, the \enquote{preliminary proposal} should have an abstract of around 250 words.}

\section{Statement of Problem}
The student drafts a thesis proposal, whose length should not exceed 20 pages (excluding tables and list of references) using the following conventions: 1.5 line spacing; Times New Roman, 12-point font; 2.5cm margins, numbered pages and single-side printing. Note, in the 6290 course, the proposal is to be 15 pages, excluding the title page, abstract page, and bibliography.

\section{Conceptual Framework}
You might include a diagram here, as in Figure \ref{fig:logo}. As per APA6, when you use a figure that has been adapted or copied directly from another source, you need to reference that original source. This reference appears as a caption underneath the figure (image):

\begin{APAitemize}
\item don't include a title on top - the caption is your title
\item concise explanation of the figure; i.e. a brief but descriptive phrase
\item include copyright information
\item format your caption - use italics and a capital F for Figure and sequential numbering (if you have more than one Figure)
\end{APAitemize}

\caption{This logo isn't required, it is an example of a figure}
\label{fig:logo}
\end{figure}

\section{Literature Review}
You will likely include parenthetical references, sometimes with page numbers \parencite[p.\,12-14]{writer2109Best}, you may sometimes reference just the title of a work, like \citetitle{author2010Great}, or perhaps just the author name, like  \citeauthor{writer2109Best}. All of the cited works will automatically be added to the references section at the end.
